<h2 id="note-1---you-typically-get-3-tries-per-question">Note 1 - You (typically) get 3 tries per question</h2>

<p><img src="images/example_quiz_points.png" /></p>

<p>(This might be updated for True/False questions)</p>

<p>notes:
right now its ~100%, 84%, 50% for each choice but we might update this for T/F questions since there are only true choices</p>

<p>same with multi-check boxes, we might update this to give you more tries, but we might just leave as it to keep it simple.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

<h1 id="names-activity">Names Activity</h1>

<hr />

<h2 id="naming-activity--introduction-to-each-other">Naming activity &amp; Introduction to Each Other</h2>

<p>We’ll first give you  ~2 minutes to write down some notes/data about “your” name.  Here “your” name can be your actual name, a nickname for you, the name of a pet, favorite place, etc.</p>

<p>Then we are going to break up into groups, where you’ll chat with each other about your <em>name</em> (or the name of a place, 
person, animal, etc that is meaningful to you).</p>

<p>Talk a little about your name.  Does it mean something?  Where does it come from?</p>

<p>Afterward, we’ll reconvene, allow for a few people to share a bit, and then we will break back out into our groups.</p>

<p>notes:
set some timers for these things!</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="names---visualization">Names - Visualization</h2>

<p>Now in your groups again, we want you to think about telling a story about names.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do we tell a visual story about this?</li>
  <li>What information – <em>data</em> – can we obtain about names?</li>
</ul>

<p>We will break <em>back</em> into groups and share this, and sketch out a handful of ideas.</p>

<p>Questions?</p>

<p>notes:
<strong>go through and then ask if folks have questions</strong></p>

<p>In your groups, we want you to think about telling a story about names.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do we tell a visual story about this?</li>
  <li>What information – <em>data</em> – can we obtain about names?</li>
</ul>

<p>We will break <em>back</em> into groups and share this, and sketch out a handful of ideas.</p>

<p>A few things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>one person in your group will need to be logged in to google through your @illinois.edu address</li>
  <li>make sure you are only working on <em>your group’s</em> board</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>And go!</strong>
