# Intro to Data Sources

notes:
so today we are going to have a quick introduction to the suggested data sources that you might want to investigate for your final data stories & have some time to play around with GDS with these sources

these are resources that are well vetted, *well documented* and are (relatively) easy to access and so are good to use for our kind of work

we will also have time for you to brainstorm your own "good" sources for data!

# Data Sources

Our data sources.  We will explore:

 * data.world
 * data.gov
 * data.illinois.gov
 * data.humdata.org


notes:
we'll be exploring these things more with GDS next week and the one after, but we'll get a quick intro here

# Data Sources

We will will divide into **Tweet Critique** groups and explore:

 * data.world
 * data.gov
 * data.illinois.gov
 * data.humdata.org

Prepare an introduction to between one and three datasets you identify that you
are interested in exploring.  Think about these things:

 * What format is the data in?
 * What is the type of data (rows, columns, connectivity, etc)
 * What story might be hidden?
 
Use Google Data Studio to make an interactive plot with your data. (More on how to do this when we get there).

notes:
use about 10 minutes to explore the data together

1. find interesting data
1. answer these questions together
1. you do *not* have to do any visualizations with this data at this step (some of the websites will have their own viz options as well)

**more about this next week and/or later today based on time!!**
