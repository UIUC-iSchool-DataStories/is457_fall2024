  * If you are late be sure to pick up your name card for partial points!
  * Please write your `uuid` on the back of your name card
1. Grade for attendance will be updated ~weekly on Canvas (going forward)


notes:
* go over each of these

#### Policies
1. We drop the 2 lowest attendance scores (inlcuding 0 for missed classes)
  * this will align with dropping the 2 lowest in class activities -- *if the due date of the activity is during class no points will be awarded if you are absent*
1. Longer absenses due to illness -- please reach out to us immediately and contact the [Absense Letter](https://odos.illinois.edu/resources/students/absence-letters) center; emergencies go to the [Emergency Dean](https://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/emergency-dean)
1. You can make up points due to other absenses by doing well on the reading quizzes!

notes:
* make point about in class activities that are due during class not being given points if you are not present
* but in class activities where you have extra time outside class (like the group contracts) -- you can still get credit for this
* longer absenses require documentation -- we need to be equitable to all students and abide by the policies in the syllabus
