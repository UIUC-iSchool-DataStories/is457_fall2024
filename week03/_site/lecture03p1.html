<h4 id="policies">Policies</h4>
<ol>
  <li>We drop the 2 lowest attendance scores (inlcuding 0 for missed classes)
    <ul>
      <li>this will align with dropping the 2 lowest in class activities – <em>if the due date of the activity is during class no points will be awarded if you are absent</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Longer absenses due to illness – please reach out to us immediately and contact the <a href="https://odos.illinois.edu/resources/students/absence-letters">Absense Letter</a> center; emergencies go to the <a href="https://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/emergency-dean">Emergency Dean</a></li>
  <li>You can make up points due to other absenses by doing well on the reading quizzes!</li>
</ol>

<p>notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>make point about in class activities that are due during class not being given points if you are not present</li>
  <li>but in class activities where you have extra time outside class (like the group contracts) – you can still get credit for this</li>
  <li>longer absenses require documentation – we need to be equitable to all students and abide by the policies in the syllabus</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="group-contracts">Group Contracts</h2>

<p>We will actually talk about these towards the end of class!</p>

<p>Take away: important to define group norms and expectations early on (and update as needed).</p>
