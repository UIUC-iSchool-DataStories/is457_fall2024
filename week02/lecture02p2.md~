# A few more notes about quizzes

notes:
just a few more details about reading quizzes!

---

## Note 1 - You (typically) get 3 tries per question

(This might be updated for True/False questions)

notes:
right now its ~100%, 84%, 50% for each choice but we might update this for T/F questions since there are only true choices 

same with multi-check boxes, we might update this to give you more tries, but we might just leave as it to keep it simple.  

Stay tuned!

# Names Activity

---

## Naming activity & Introduction to Each Other

We'll first give you  ~2 minutes to write down some notes/data about "your" name.  Here "your" name can be your actual name, a nickname for you, the name of a pet, favorite place, etc.

Then we are going to break up into groups, where you'll chat with each other about your *name* (or the name of a place, 
person, animal, etc that is meaningful to you).

Talk a little about your name.  Does it mean something?  Where does it come from?

Afterward, we'll reconvene, allow for a few people to share a bit, and then we will break back out into our groups.

notes:
set some timers for these things!

## Names - Visualization

Now in your groups again, we want you to think about telling a story about names.

 * How do we tell a visual story about this?
 * What information -- *data* -- can we obtain about names?

We will break *back* into groups and share this, and sketch out a handful of ideas.
 
Questions?

notes:
**go through and then ask if folks have questions**

## Names - Visualization

In your new breakout rooms, we want you to think about telling a story about names.

 * How do we tell a visual story about this?
 * What information -- *data* -- can we obtain about names?

We will break *back* into groups and share this, and sketch out a handful of ideas.

A few things:
 1. one person in your group will need to be logged in to google through your @illinois.edu address
 2. only one person from the group should be accessing the jamboard -- there is a limit of 50 people per jamboard
 
**And go!** https://jamboard.google.com/d/1TX-2VdAE96SZPf8--Nd44OCuKh4H1V1eWMIgOC-Jd-4/edit?usp=sharing
