## But first!  A moment about TurnItIn

notes:
there is a video and a set of slides that walk you through the turnitin process which is how we are detecting plagurism which will be active on Assignment #4

## But first!  A moment about TurnItIn

This is nobody's favorite thing.

notes:
so, I just want to call out here that this stuff isn't fun to talk about or think about!

## But first!  A moment about TurnItIn

This is nobody's favorite thing.

But we [do have to think about it](https://provost.illinois.edu/policies/policies/academic-integrity/students-quick-reference-guide-to-academic-integrity/).

notes:
but, this is something that the university takes very seriously, so we do have to pay attention to these issues

## But first!  A moment about TurnItIn

This is nobody's favorite thing.

But we [do have to think about it](https://provost.illinois.edu/policies/policies/academic-integrity/students-quick-reference-guide-to-academic-integrity/).

Using TurnItIn as we will in this course is our way to make this as transparent a process as possible.

notes:
so, as you'll see in the video and reading quiz - you will be able to see your turnitin report and the reasoning behind this is that we want you to be able to see *how we will assess* plagurism

why? because some folks have been thinking about citations and plagurism their whole lives, but folks are coming from educational systems in which they haven't had to deal with this as much

we want to support all of you!  so take this as a learning opportunity to understand a bit more about how to do technical writing at the UIUC educational environment

more info will be in the TurnItIn recorded lecture and slides!
